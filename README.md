## This is the a test run of using jquery to create a simple webpage and have it all run from jquery libraries.


Our objectives for this particular webpage were to:

Use jquery for the set up of each webpage

Use a header/ navigation bar and a footer that would appear on each page exactly the same.

Come up with original content to practice mixing jquery with previous knowledge.

Link pages together to create a functioning website.

I made these webpages by first downloading the jquery to my library, and then I made the basic outline for each page. After that was done, I added functionality to the links in the navigation so that pages can be accessed from each other. Finally, I added in images and text, and styled them similar to some references and in a simple and easy to read way.
